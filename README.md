# Project Gutenberg Knowledge Base

A curated corpus of public domain literary texts from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) — organized for analysis, annotation, and knowledge extraction.

## About This Dataset

This repository contains **public domain literary texts** sourced from Project Gutenberg, organized by author and work. Texts are provided both as full ebooks and as individual sections to support fine-grained annotation and analysis.

- **`data/ebooks/`** — Full plain-text ebooks organized by Project Gutenberg ID
- **`authors/`** — Texts organized by author and title, with works split into named sections (chapters, acts, scenes, etc.)

All content is in the public domain and freely available via [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).

This corpus is well-suited for entity recognition across characters, authors, places, and historical references; mapping relationships between characters, themes, and narrative arcs; stylistic and linguistic analysis across authors and time periods; and building literary knowledge graphs from unstructured text.

## Quick Start

Explore this dataset using [Semiont](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont), an open-source knowledge base platform for annotation and knowledge extraction.

This repo follows the same layout and startup flow as [`semiont-template-kb`](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont-template-kb). See its README for full setup instructions:

- [Quick Start: Local](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont-template-kb#quick-start-local) — run the backend stack on your machine via `.semiont/scripts/start.sh`
- [Quick Start: Codespaces](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont-template-kb#quick-start-codespaces) — launch a preconfigured backend in the cloud
- [Inference Configuration](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont-template-kb#inference-configuration) — Ollama (local) vs. Anthropic (cloud) configs

### Open in Codespaces

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new/The-AI-Alliance/gutenberg-kb)

> **Before launching:** add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as a [user secret](https://github.com/settings/codespaces) with this repo selected. Otherwise the backend comes up but inference is non-functional until you add the secret and rebuild the container.
